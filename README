To run:

`npm run start`


Free Heroku quirks:

The app lives on Heroku but there are some slightly odd workarounds I've run into on the free tier.

Within the app there is an express server that runs. It doesn't actually serve any content, it just makes sure that any requests to the app url return 404 rather than 503 and heroku will consider the app crashed otherwise and stop all processes.

In the heroku app dashboard I have also configered the scheduler to start the process every morning at UTC; 8:30, 9:30 and 10:30.

This is because the Heroku dyno falls asleep and cancels the cron jobs otherwise.

Unfortunately the scheduler can't be configured to run at specific times a week. Only minutely, hourly or daily. Hence using it to bump the app into life every morning.

This is a little messy, but keeps us within the free category of dyno usage.

I'm considering alternatives to Heroku as this is all a little hacky. perhaps a series of lambdas or something instead?
